# game Design: Xia's Revenge

Individual Game Design Project (Open Prompt) 
<br>Solo project that aimed to take storytelling of martial arts blend with board and card game tactics.

<b>Xia’s Revenge</b> tells a story of love-turned-hatred, of loss of family, of a chosen family built on
close friendship, and of revenge and protection of homeland. As a multiplayer social-deduction
and character strategy card game combo, Xia’s Revenge is set in the empire of JiangHu, where martial arts
skills determine one’s strength. With six unique characters guided only by their conscience (or
lack thereof), it’s a race of revenge and elimination.
